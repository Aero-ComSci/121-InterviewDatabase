Why did I choose the questions?
 I chose these questions because they are school related and provide a useful database for the school as school lunches are quite vital to our health and learning as well.

I wanted to add in the perspective of the students so that our staff cna take into account their opinions as well to better the menu for the greater good. If our school lunch isnt healthy, it is important ot know that its not good to eat. This being said, we should be able ot recognize this and move forward and change the food that we serve
